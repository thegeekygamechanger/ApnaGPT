```
import pandas as pd

# Read the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

print(df.head())  # Print the first few rows of the data
```

In this code, we're importing the Pandas library and then reading a CSV file named 'data.csv' into a DataFrame object called `df`. The `head()` method is used to print the first few rows of the data.

If you want to read JSON data, you can use the `json` module:

```
import json

# Read the JSON file
with open('data.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

print(data)  # Print the JSON data
```

In this code, we're opening a JSON file named 'data.json' and loading its contents into a Python dictionary called `data`. The `print()` statement is used to print the JSON data.

If you want to read Excel files, you can use the `openpyxl` library:

```
from openpyxl import load_workbook

# Read the Excel file
wb = load_workbook('data.xlsx')
sheet = wb['Sheet1']

for row in sheet.iter_rows(values_only=True):
    print(row)  # Print each row of data
```

In this code, we're loading an Excel file named 'data.xlsx' into a workbook object called `wb`. We then select the first sheet and iterate over its rows using the `iter_rows()` method. The `values_only=True` parameter tells the method to return only the values in each row.

These are just a few examples of how you can ingest data in Python. The specific library or method you use will depend on the format of your data and your specific needs."
