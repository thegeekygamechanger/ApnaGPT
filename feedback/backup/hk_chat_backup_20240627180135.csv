```java
import org.apache.nifi.components.PrioritizedApprovedStatus;
import org.apache.nifi.flowfile.FlowFile;
import org.apache.nifi.processor.Processor;
import org.apache.nifi.processor.exception.FailToWriteException;

public class KitabPadhoIndiaDataIngestion extends Processor {

    @Override
    public void onTrigger(ProcessorTrigger trigger) {
        FlowFile flowFile = trigger.getFlowFile();
        
        // Read data from the source (e.g. a CSV file or a database)
        String data = readSourceData(flowFile);
        
        // Process the data (e.g. convert it to JSON, filter out unnecessary fields)
        String processedData = processData(data);
        
        // Write the processed data to the target (e.g. a database or a file)
        writeTargetData(processedData);
    }

    private String readSourceData(FlowFile flowFile) {
        // Implement your logic to read data from the source
        return ""Sample Data"";
    }

    private String processData(String data) {
        // Implement your logic to process the data
        return data;
    }

    private void writeTargetData(String data) {
        // Implement your logic to write the processed data to the target
    }
}
```

This is a basic example of how you could design a data ingestion pipeline in Java using Apache NiFi. You would need to implement the `readSourceData`, `processData`, and `writeTargetData` methods according to your specific requirements.

Please note that this is just an example, and you may need to modify it based on your actual use case."
