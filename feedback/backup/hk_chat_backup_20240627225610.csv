To achieve this, you can start by finding or becoming the one to educate students in your demographic area. This can be done through connections with coaching classes, schools, colleges nearby or far. No need to search manually.

For rural area students, you can help them by becoming a helping hand. Donate, give at rent, sell on KitabPadhoIndia.com and get loyalties, royalties, and the chance to be on the portal and inspire others.

You also want to share the improvement before and after becoming a helping hand to particular or group of students. And be the proud helping hand and motivate others.

What's your next question?"
