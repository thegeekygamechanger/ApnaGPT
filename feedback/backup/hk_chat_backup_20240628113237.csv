To address your concerns, I'll provide some insights based on the context provided.

You mentioned that the existing facilitators have limitations such as:

1. No active and un-interactive portals.
2. Time-consuming service.
3. Lacks of facilities.
4. No appropriate details.

Considering these challenges, you've developed KitaabPadhoIndia.com to address the needs of students in rural areas. Your initiative aims to reuse books and equipment, reducing waste and pollution, while making education more accessible and affordable for students.

Some potential solutions or ideas that can be explored include:

* Creating an online platform where students can access educational resources, including used books and equipment.
* Developing a peer-to-peer learning system, where students can share knowledge and resources with each other.
* Partnering with local schools, colleges, and coaching classes to provide practical sessions, knowledge videos, and courses based on student purchases.
* Offering connections with coaching classes, schools, and colleges nearby or far, eliminating the need for manual searching.
* For rural area students, providing options for book donations, rentals, or sales through KitaabPadhoIndia.com, generating loyalties, royalties, and opportunities to inspire others.

These ideas can help address the concerns you've raised, such as:

* Redundant and old ideas of help (by reusing books and equipment).
* Overpriced items (by providing affordable access to educational resources).
* Unsatisfactory experiences (by creating a user-friendly online platform).

Please let me know if there's anything specific you'd like me to focus on or if you have any further questions!"

Based on the given context, I'll try to provide a detailed response.

It seems like you're discussing an idea called KitabPadhoIndia, which aims to address the issue of students lacking resources for their academic practice. You've shared an example of how you and your friend struggled to find engineering instruments in your area, but then decided to take matters into your own hands by reusing used books and equipment.

You've also highlighted some key issues, such as:

* Redundant and old ideas of help
* Unsatisfactory experience
* Overpriced items

And you're looking for a solution that addresses these concerns. You've mentioned the importance of ""NECESSITY IS MOTHER OF INVENTION"" and how it motivated you to take action.

Some potential solutions that come to mind include:

* Creating an online platform where students can buy, sell, or rent used books and equipment
* Partnering with local coaching classes, schools, and colleges to provide resources and support
* Developing a system for students to share their own experiences and knowledge with others

What do you think? Would you like me to elaborate on any of these ideas or explore other potential solutions?"
